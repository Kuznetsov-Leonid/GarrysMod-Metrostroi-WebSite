    <p id="pointText">Detailed description</p>
    <p id="opisanieEG"> The first experimental 81-760 / 761 three-car train was manufactured in 2010.  After manufacturing, it was sent to the Moscow Metro for testing.  On June 19, 2010, at the Maryina Roshcha station on the newly opened section of the Lublin line of the Moscow Metro, the presentation of the first experimental train to the mayor of the city and journalists took place.  During the year, five more cars were manufactured and the train was brought to an eight-car composition.  A distinctive feature of this train was the stylized numbers “75”, depicted in front of the head cars in honor of the 75th anniversary of the Moscow Metro.  On serial trains, such an inscription was not applied.

         In the second half of 2011, the tests of the prototype were completed, and JSC Metrovagonmash began preparations for their serial production.  In September 2011, the plant signed a contract with the electrical engineering concern Ruselprom for the supply of traction motors for cars, as well as line filter smoothing reactors designed to equalize voltage drops in the network.

         To accelerate the pace of production, it was decided to arrange the assembly of a part of intermediate cars by order of Transmashholding at the Tver Carriage Works.  In October 2011, a prototype of an intermediate car body was sent from the Metrowagonmash plant to the Tver plant for mastering the construction of car bodies of this type.

         Mass production of 81-760 / 761 electric trains began in late 2011 - early 2012, and in February 2012 they began to enter the Moscow Metro.  On May 25, 2012 it became known that the carriages of type 81-760 / 761 were named “Oka”.  During the production of these cars, changes were made to their design;  one of the most notable was the redesign of the buffer lamps.  In 2011, LED headlights instead of halogen ones were installed on the head cars 37001 and 37002 of the experimental train, but this option was initially abandoned.  The first 90 serial head cars (37003-37092) were equipped with halogen headlights, but at the beginning of 2013, starting with car 37093, it was decided to return to LED headlights.

         In December 2014, the thousandth car of the Oka metro was manufactured at the Metrowagonmash plant.

         The production of cars was completed in 2016 due to the transition to the production of the updated model 81-765 / 766/767 "Moscow".  In total, during the period from 2010 to 2016, 324 head and 972 intermediate cars of the basic model 81-760 / 761 "Oka" were built, on the basis of which 162 eight-car trains were formed.  At the same time, judging by the numbering, 326 head and 975 intermediate cars were de jure, but de facto the cars of the five-car train, originally intended for Baku, were renumbered after returning to Moscow, and their original numbers ceased to exist.</p>
